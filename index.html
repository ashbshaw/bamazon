                <p>In this project, I creating a storefront through the use of newly-acquired MySQL skills.
                    The app allows the user "customer" to select a product for purchase, and the store updates inventory
                    accordingly.
                    If there is not enough inventory, the store alerts the customer. I chose a backyard pool party theme
                    because it's currently February, and this winter has been awful.</p>

                <h2>Project Instructions</h2>
                <h4>Customer Interface</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a MySQL Database called Bamazon.</li>
                    <li>Then, create a table inside of that database called products.</li>
                    <li>The products table should have each of the following columns:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Item_id (unique id for each product)</li>
                            <li>Product_name (Name of product)</li>
                            <li>Department_name</li>
                            <li>Price (cost to customer)</li>
                            <li>Stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Populate this database with around 10 different products (i.e. insert "mock" data rows into this
                        database and table).</li>
                    <li>Then, create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first
                        display all information about all of the items available for sale.</li>
                    <li>The products table should have each of the following columns:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.</li>
                            <li>The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough
                        of the product to meet the customer's request:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If not, the app should log a phase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the
                                order from going through.</li>
                            <li>If so, the app will fullfill the order and update the SQL database to reflect the
                                remaining quantity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.</li>
                </ol>
